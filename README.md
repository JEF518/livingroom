# livingroom

This is a frontend project to create an interactive living room using only vanilla frontend tools (html, js, css)

You can visit it here: https://jf-livingroom.herokuapp.com/ , feel free to switch on some mood lighting and listen to a record.

It is *not* currently mobile compatible- best viewed on a desktop.
